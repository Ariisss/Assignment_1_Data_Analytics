    "This study aims to apply **Balanced Risk Set Matching** as a statistical method to improve causal inference in observational studies where treatment assignment is based on evolving patient conditions rather than randomization. By implementing **risk set matching**, treated patients are paired with untreated patients who had similar symptom histories up to the time of treatment, ensuring comparability at the moment of intervention. Additionally, **integer programming** is used to balance the distributions of key covariates across matched groups, minimizing bias in treatment effect estimation. This approach is applied to analyze the impact of cystoscopy and hydrodistention on interstitial cystitis symptoms, with a **sensitivity analysis** assessing the robustness of findings to hidden biases. The study ultimately aims to enhance the validity of treatment comparisons in non-randomized medical research."
