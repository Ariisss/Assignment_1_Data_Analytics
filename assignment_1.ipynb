    "This study aims to apply **Balanced Risk Set Matching** as a statistical method to improve causal inference in observational studies where treatment assignment is based on evolving patient conditions rather than randomization. By implementing **risk set matching**, treated patients are paired with untreated patients who had similar symptom histories up to the time of treatment, ensuring comparability at the moment of intervention. Additionally, **integer programming** is used to balance the distributions of key covariates across matched groups, minimizing bias in treatment effect estimation. This approach is applied to analyze the impact of cystoscopy and hydrodistention on interstitial cystitis symptoms, with a **sensitivity analysis** assessing the robustness of findings to hidden biases. The study ultimately aims to enhance the validity of treatment comparisons in non-randomized medical research.\n",

    "# Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing\n",
    "- Load the dataset, ensuring it contains treatment times, symptom histories, and follow-up measures.\n",
    "- Standardize symptom measures for comparability.\n",
    "- Identify treated vs. untreated patients and structure data for time-sequenced analysis.\n",
    "- Output: Cleaned dataset with time-ordered symptom histories and treatment indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Risk Set Matching\n",
    "- Identify risk sets by finding untreated patients who have a similar symptom history as a treated patient up to the time of treatment.\n",
    "- Ensure that future data is not used for matching.\n",
    "- Compute Mahalanobis distance to measure similarity between treated and untreated patients.\n",
    "- Output: Initial pool of potential matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Optimal Matching via Integer Programming\n",
    "- Implement integer programming to:\n",
    "    - Minimize Mahalanobis distance between treated and control pairs.\n",
    "    - Ensure balanced covariate distributions across groups.\n",
    "- Use network flow optimization to efficiently find the best matches.\n",
    "- Output: Finalized matched dataset with treatment-control pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Sensitivity Analysis for Hidden Bias \n",
    "- Introduce an unobserved covariate to simulate hidden biases.\n",
    "- Evaluate how much hidden bias would be needed to invalidate the results.\n",
    "- Conduct proportional hazards modeling to analyze potential confounders.\n",
    "- Output: Bias-adjusted estimates of treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Statistical Analysis & Interpretation\n",
    "- Perform hypothesis testing to compare treatment vs. control groups:\n",
    "    - Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for pairwise comparisons.\n",
    "    - Permutation tests to validate significance.\n",
    "    - Multivariate analysis if multiple symptom outcomes are evaluated.\n",
    "- Generate visualizations (boxplots, histograms) to inspect trends in symptom changes.\n",
    "- Output: Statistical validation of treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Reporting & Conclusion\n",
    "- Summarize methodology, findings, and potential biases.\n",
    "- Present results through:\n",
    "    - Summary tables (descriptive statistics).\n",
    "    - Graphs & charts (symptom trends over time).\n",
    "    - Sensitivity analysis conclusions (robustness of findings).\n",
    "- Output: Final research paper/report with validated conclusions.\n",
