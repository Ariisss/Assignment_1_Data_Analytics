## Objective:
This project aims to apply Balanced Risk Set Matching (BRSM) as a statistical technique to improve causal inference in observational studies where treatment assignment is based on evolving patient conditions rather than randomization. The study focuses on matching treated and untreated patients with similar symptom histories, optimizing matches using integer programming, and conducting sensitivity analyses to assess hidden biases.
